Chest pain is one of the commonest complains referred by patients at the emergency department. The first step is to exclude or to confirm if the patient has one of the five diseases which can have as the main complaint chest pain, and are related to sudden death: myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, hypertensive pneumothorax, and Boerhaave Syndrome.</p>
<p>To investigate those diseases, we need to analyze the clinical history and physical examination data, as some of them can increase or reduce the probability of each disease as we can see in the following tables:
<div class='case_link'><a href='Clinical_History_Myocardial_infarction.html' onclick="computeLink('Clinical_History_Myocardial_infarction')">Clinical History Myocardial infarction</a></div>
<div class='case_link'><a href='Physical_examination_myocardial_infarction.html' onclick="computeLink('Physical_examination_myocardial_infarction')">Physical examination myocardial infarction</a></div>
<div class='case_link'><a href='Clinical_History_Aortic_Dissection.html' onclick="computeLink('Clinical_History_Aortic_Dissection')">Clinical History Aortic Dissection</a></div>
<div class='case_link'><a href='Physical_Examination_Aortic_Dissection.html' onclick="computeLink('Physical_Examination_Aortic_Dissection')">Physical Examination Aortic Dissection</a></div>
<div class='case_link'><a href='Pulmonary_embolism_Wells_criteria.html' onclick="computeLink('Pulmonary_embolism_Wells_criteria')">Pulmonary embolism Wells criteria</a></div></p>
<p>Hypertensive pneumothorax is more common in longelineous young adults (primary pneumothorax) or in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases or chest trauma (secondary pneumothorax). On Physical examination, we expect asymmetry in lung auscultation and the trachea may be dislocated to the contralateral side of the pneumothorax.</p>
<p>Boerhhave Syndrome is more common in patients who presented vomiting before chest pain, were submitted to endoscopic procedures or had chest trauma.
As our patient has hypertension, we could be worried about aortic dissection, but there is no other data that increase it´s likelihood ratio. Also, there is no data that increases myocardial infarction likelihood ratio. Also, our patient has no feature of Wells criteria for now, but it´s is important to ask him about immobilization, trips or recent surgery.</p>
